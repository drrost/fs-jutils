# FastStream Java Utilities - Testing Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the testing requirements and best practices for the FastStream Java Utilities (fs-jutils) library. Following these requirements ensures code quality, reliability, and maintainability across the project.

## General Testing Principles

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All public methods must have corresponding unit tests.
2. **Edge Cases**: Tests should cover normal cases, edge cases, and error conditions.
3. **Isolation**: Tests should be independent and not rely on the state of other tests.
4. **Readability**: Tests should be clear, well-organized, and easy to understand.
5. **Maintainability**: Tests should be easy to maintain and update as the codebase evolves.

## Test Organization

1. **Package Structure**:
   - Test classes should mirror the structure of the main codebase
   - Place test classes in the corresponding package under `src/test/java`

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Test classes should be named with the class they test followed by "Test" (e.g., `FSStringUtilsTest`)
   - Test methods should have descriptive names that indicate what is being tested
   - Use camelCase for test method names

3. **Test Structure**:
   - Use JUnit 5 for all tests
   - Organize related tests using nested test classes (`@Nested`)
   - Use `@DisplayName` to provide descriptive names for test classes and methods
   - Follow the Given-When-Then format for test methods

## Test Coverage Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - All public methods must have unit tests
   - Test both positive and negative scenarios
   - Aim for at least 80% code coverage for all classes
   - Critical utility classes should have 90%+ coverage

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test boundary conditions (empty strings, null values, etc.)
   - Test with minimum and maximum values where applicable
   - Test with invalid inputs to verify proper error handling

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Verify that methods throw the expected exceptions for invalid inputs
   - Test exception messages for clarity and correctness
   - Ensure exceptions are properly documented in JavaDoc

## Multi-Threaded Testing

1. **Thread Safety**:
   - Classes that claim to be thread-safe must have multi-threaded tests
   - Test concurrent access to shared resources
   - Verify that operations remain atomic when required

2. **Concurrency Testing Techniques**:
   - Use `CountDownLatch` for coordinating thread execution
   - Use `ExecutorService` for managing thread pools
   - Use atomic variables for detecting failures across threads
   - Test with varying thread counts to ensure scalability

3. **Race Condition Testing**:
   - Design tests to maximize the likelihood of exposing race conditions
   - Use stress testing with high thread counts for critical components
   - Test mixed operations (read/write) concurrently

## Performance Testing

1. **Benchmarking**:
   - Benchmark critical operations to ensure performance meets requirements
   - Compare performance against previous versions to detect regressions
   - Document performance characteristics for critical methods

2. **Load Testing**:
   - Test behavior under high load for resource-intensive operations
   - Verify memory usage remains within acceptable limits
   - Test with large inputs to ensure scalability

## Test Documentation

1. **Test Comments**:
   - Document the purpose of each test class and complex test methods
   - Explain the rationale behind complex test setups
   - Document any assumptions or dependencies

2. **Test Structure**:
   - Use the Given-When-Then format in comments to clarify test structure
   - Clearly separate setup, execution, and verification phases

## Test Maintenance

1. **Refactoring**:
   - Update tests when refactoring code
   - Ensure tests remain valid after changes to implementation details
   - Use abstractions to minimize the impact of implementation changes on tests

2. **Test Data**:
   - Use meaningful test data that represents real-world scenarios
   - Avoid hardcoding large datasets in test methods
   - Use helper methods or constants for common test data

## Continuous Integration

1. **Automated Testing**:
   - All tests must pass in the CI environment
   - Configure CI to run tests on every pull request
   - Run tests with different Java versions to ensure compatibility

2. **Code Coverage Reporting**:
   - Configure CI to generate code coverage reports
   - Track coverage trends over time
   - Address areas with insufficient coverage

## Test-Driven Development

1. **TDD Approach**:
   - Write tests before implementing new features when possible
   - Use tests to drive the design of new components
   - Refactor code and tests iteratively

2. **Regression Testing**:
   - Add regression tests for fixed bugs
   - Document the issue being addressed in the test

## Mocking and Test Doubles

1. **External Dependencies**:
   - Use mocks or stubs for external dependencies
   - Avoid tests that depend on external services or resources
   - Use dependency injection to facilitate testing with mocks

2. **Mocking Frameworks**:
   - Use Mockito for creating mocks when needed
   - Document complex mock setups

## Conclusion

Following these testing requirements ensures that the FastStream Java Utilities library remains reliable, maintainable, and high-quality. All contributors should adhere to these standards when writing tests for the codebase.
