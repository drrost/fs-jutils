# FastStream Java Utilities - Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of improvement tasks for the FastStream Java Utilities library. Tasks are organized by category and should be completed in the order listed for maximum efficiency.

## Documentation Improvements

[ ] 1. Enhance README.md with:
   - [ ] Detailed description of the library's purpose
   - [ ] Installation instructions
   - [ ] Usage examples for each utility class
   - [ ] Contribution guidelines
   - [ ] License information

[X] 2. Add JavaDoc to all public classes and methods:
   - [X] FSStringUtils
   - [X] FSDateUtils
   - [X] FSJsonUtils
   - [X] FSNameUtils
   - [X] FSFileUtils
   - [X] FSFileSystemUtils
   - [X] FSPhoneNumberFormatter
   - [X] FSRandomUtils
   - [X] FSRnokppUtils

[ ] 3. Create a developer guide with:
   - [ ] Architecture overview
   - [ ] Coding standards
   - [ ] Testing requirements

## Architecture Improvements

[ ] 4. Standardize naming conventions:
   - [ ] Ensure all utility classes have consistent "FS" prefix
   - [ ] Rename FileSystemUtils to FSFileSystemUtils for consistency

[ ] 5. Organize classes into logical packages:
   - [ ] Create string package for string utilities
   - [ ] Create date package for date utilities
   - [ ] Create file package for file utilities
   - [ ] Create json package for JSON utilities

[ ] 6. Implement interfaces for better abstraction:
   - [ ] Define interfaces for major utility categories
   - [ ] Allow for alternative implementations

[ ] 7. Reduce class sizes by splitting large utility classes:
   - [ ] Split FSDateUtils into smaller, focused classes
   - [ ] Split FSStringUtils into smaller, focused classes

[ ] 8. Implement proper dependency injection:
   - [ ] Remove direct instantiation of dependencies (e.g., ObjectMapper)
   - [ ] Allow for configuration of dependencies

## Code Quality Improvements

[X] 9. Standardize error handling:
   - [X] Create custom exceptions for the library
   - [X] Replace generic RuntimeExceptions with specific exceptions
   - [X] Add proper context to exception messages

[ ] 10. Improve null safety:
   - [ ] Add null checks to all public methods
   - [ ] Consider using Optional for methods that may return null
   - [ ] Document null behavior in JavaDoc

[ ] 11. Modernize date handling:
   - [ ] Replace legacy Date API with java.time API consistently
   - [ ] Create conversion utilities between legacy and modern APIs
   - [ ] Add timezone support to date operations

[ ] 12. Improve internationalization:
   - [ ] Replace hardcoded Ukrainian month names with proper localization
   - [ ] Use ResourceBundle for localized strings
   - [ ] Support multiple locales for date formatting

[ ] 13. Optimize performance:
   - [ ] Cache frequently used objects (e.g., DateTimeFormatter, ObjectMapper)
   - [ ] Reduce unnecessary object creation
   - [ ] Use StringBuilder for string concatenation in loops

[ ] 14. Remove code duplication:
   - [ ] Consolidate duplicate methods in FSFileSystemUtils and FileSystemUtils
   - [ ] Refactor similar methods to use common helper methods
   - [ ] Create utility methods for common operations

[ ] 15. Fix code smells:
   - [ ] Remove commented-out code
   - [ ] Fix inconsistent method signatures
   - [ ] Remove System.out.println statements
   - [ ] Fix magic numbers and strings

## Testing Improvements

[ ] 16. Increase test coverage:
   - [ ] Add tests for all public methods
   - [ ] Add tests for edge cases (null inputs, empty strings, etc.)
   - [ ] Add tests for error conditions

[X] 17. Standardize test structure:
   - [X] Use consistent Given-When-Then format for all tests
   - [X] Use descriptive test names
   - [X] Group related tests together

[ ] 18. Add integration tests:
   - [ ] Test interactions between utility classes
   - [ ] Test with real-world data

[ ] 19. Add performance tests:
   - [ ] Benchmark critical operations
   - [ ] Ensure performance meets requirements

[ ] 20. Implement continuous integration:
   - [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - [ ] Add code coverage reporting
   - [ ] Add static code analysis

## Build and Deployment Improvements

[ ] 21. Update build configuration:
   - [ ] Add version management
   - [ ] Configure artifact signing
   - [ ] Add build profiles for different environments

[ ] 22. Improve dependency management:
   - [ ] Update dependencies to latest versions
   - [ ] Minimize external dependencies
   - [ ] Add dependency vulnerability scanning

[ ] 23. Enhance release process:
   - [ ] Automate version bumping
   - [ ] Generate release notes
   - [ ] Publish to Maven Central

## Security Improvements

[ ] 24. Add security checks:
   - [ ] Validate inputs to prevent injection attacks
   - [ ] Sanitize file paths
   - [ ] Handle sensitive data securely

[ ] 25. Implement secure coding practices:
   - [ ] Use secure random number generation
   - [ ] Implement proper exception handling to prevent information leakage
   - [ ] Add input validation to all public methods

## Future Enhancements

[ ] 26. Add new utility classes:
   - [ ] Collection utilities
   - [ ] Concurrency utilities
   - [ ] Validation utilities

[ ] 27. Add support for modern Java features:
